RANSAC, short for Random Sample Consensus, is an iterative algorithm used for robust fitting of models in the presence of many outliers in a dataset. It works by randomly selecting subsets of the data, fitting a model to each subset, and then evaluating how many data points fit the model within a given tolerance. The algorithm then repeats this process multiple times and selects the model with the highest number of inliers (data points that fit well).
